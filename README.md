# Parking-system
A car arrives at a parking location at a given time (current time) and if there is a spot available, the driver opts for a preferred predefined park interval: 15min, 30min, 45min, 1hour, 1:15h, 1:30h
The task was to simulate a parking system , in this parking system are 3 types of parking zones in the city: Orange (short term parking: 15min-1h), Purple (15min-3h) and Blue (15min-24h). Prices differ depending on location (city center, busy areas, residential areas, etc). Some parking zones have a low price (eg. 20 coins / hour), while some other zones might have higher prices (eg. 80 coins / hours). For all zones, price calculation allows for 15 minute increments and hourly breakdown.
A driver can receive a notification that their parking is about to expire in 10 minutes and have the option to extend their booking by an interval of their choice, not exceeding the total time allowed for a stay at that specific location. (notifications are always sent 10 min before expiration, but the driver might choose to act upon it later onâ€¦ or never)
For some busy parking zones, prices might fluctuate during the day (more expensive at busy hours), but not dynamically/adaptive, rather predictable (known upfront to the driver).
